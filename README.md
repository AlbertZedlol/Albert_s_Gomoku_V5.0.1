# Albert-s-Gomoku_V5.0.1
This is a gobang (aka. gomoku, five in a row, etc) game written for fun.  
I started this project in march, 2022 and by june 28th, 2022 this project is almost done.
If you are a freshman in department of EE, Tsinghua University, this could be a reference to your C++ programming class 's homework "Five in A Row"
