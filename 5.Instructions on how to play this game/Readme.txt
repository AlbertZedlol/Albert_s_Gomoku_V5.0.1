to establish a connection(using IPv4 address), start to share data and eventually set chess on the same gameboard online.
    One of the players should follow procedures in video"Client", the other follows that in video "Server". Players should be aware of the timing---Server should 
start to make connection first( the system will help him/her do so automatically) and Client should type in Server's IP later(Users should do this manually).
